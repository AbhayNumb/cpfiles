spanning tree-tree which has all vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges
if graph is complete then total spanning trees is V^(V-2) // V is vertices
if graph may not be complete then 
make two matrix 
first is degree matrix that has degree of ith element stored at (i,i)
second is adjacency matrix of 0s and 1s

laplacian matrix=matrix1-matrix2
total spanning tree will be cofactor of any element
