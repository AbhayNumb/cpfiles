Certainly, I'd be happy to explain the line that splits the string using the provided separator:

String[] temp = str.split("\\Q" + separator + "\\E");
In this line of code, the split method is used to divide the string str into an array of substrings based on a specified separator
character. Let's break down the components of this line:

str: This is the string that you want to split.

separator: This is the character you want to use as a separator to split the string.

"\\Q" and "\\E": These are special markers in Java's regular expression syntax. They are used to treat the text between them as a literal 
string, rather than interpreting it as part of the regular expression pattern. This is important because the separator might contain 
characters that have special meanings in regular expressions.

\\Q: Indicates the start of the literal string.
\\E: Indicates the end of the literal string.
Putting it all together, let's say separator is '-'. If you used just str.split("-"), it would work in most cases. However, if the 
separator itself contained special characters like '[', ']', '*', etc., it could cause unexpected behavior or errors because those 
characters are interpreted as regular expression syntax. To avoid this, the code adds \\Q at the beginning and \\E at the end of the 
separator, ensuring that any potential special characters in the separator are treated as literals.

Here's an example to illustrate:

Let str be "hello-world[2023]" and separator be '-'. If you used str.split("-"), it would treat the [ and ] characters in the separator 
as special characters, which would result in an invalid regular expression and potentially an exception.

By using "\\Q" + separator + "\\E", the separator is treated as a literal string, so the actual regular expression used for splitting 
would be \\Q-\\E, which avoids any issues with special characters in the separator.

In the end, the line of code splits the input string str using the separator character while ensuring that any potential special 
characters in the separator are treated as literal characters, not as part of the regular expression syntax.
